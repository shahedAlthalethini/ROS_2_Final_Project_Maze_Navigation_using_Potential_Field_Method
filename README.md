This project focuses on developing an advanced autonomous navigation algorithm using the  **Potential Field Methods (PFM)** . The robot autonomously navigates by balancing attractive forces toward a goal and repulsive forces to avoid obstacles in real-time. This approach ensures smooth, safe, and efficient movement, maintaining high Real-time Performance within complex environments.

### Test Environments
The algorithm was rigorously tested across two distinct environments to evaluate its navigation efficiency:

1. Simple Maze
An introductory testing environment featuring open paths and distinct obstacles to evaluate the stability and baseline performance of the algorithm.

</p>

2. Complex Maze
An advanced, high-density environment featuring narrow corridors and interlocking obstacles. This environment tests the algorithm's capability to handle Local Minima and determine optimal paths under challenging conditions.

###  System Configuration (ros_gz_bridge)
The `ros_gz_bridge` acts as the vital communication layer, translating messages between the Gazebo transport layer and the ROS 2 DDS middleware.

| Topic | Gazebo Type | ROS 2 Type | Direction |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `/scan` | `gz.msgs.LaserScan` | `sensor_msgs/LaserScan` | GZ → ROS 2 |
| `/odom` | `gz.msgs.Odometry` | `nav_msgs/Odometry` | GZ → ROS 2 |
| `/cmd_vel` | `gz.msgs.Twist` | `geometry_msgs/Twist` | ROS 2 → GZ |

###  Potential Field Navigation Algorithm

#### 1. The Mathematical Model
The navigation logic is based on an  Potential Field Methods (PFM), where the robot moves according to the resultant vector of attractive and repulsive forces.

</p>

* **Attractive Force ($F_{att}$):** Generates a pull toward the goal coordinates.
    $$F_{att} = k_{att} \times (P_{goal} - P_{robot})$$
* **Repulsive Force ($F_{rep}$):** Generates a push away from obstacles detected by LiDAR.
    $$F_{rep} = k_{rep} \times \left(\frac{1}{d} - \frac{1}{d_{obs}}\right) \times \frac{1}{d^2}$$

#### 2. Handling LiDAR Data
To ensure numerical stability and prevent system crashes, a robust filtering pipeline was implemented:
* **Zeros & NaNs:** Automatically discarded to avoid division-by-zero errors in the force calculations.
* **Infs:** Treated as the maximum sensor range (5.0m), representing clear paths for navigation.

#### 3. Escape Strategy (Local Minima)

In the **Complex Maze**, standard APF often gets stuck in U-shaped traps. We implemented **Virtual Charges**:
* The robot maintains a `path_history` of its previous coordinates.
* When a stall is detected, these coordinates act as temporary "repulsive charges," pushing the robot out of dead-ends and forcing it to explore new paths toward the goal.

### Parameter Tuning
After multiple iterations in the Gazebo environment, we settled on the following gains to balance speed and safety:

| Parameter | Symbol | Simple Maze | Complex Maze | Role |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Attractive Gain | $k_{att}$ | 1.2 | 0.4 | Controls the approach velocity to the goal |
| Repulsive Gain | $k_{rep}$ | 1.0 | 4.5 | Determines the strength of obstacle avoidance |
| Influence Dist. | $d_{obs}$ | 1.5 m | 1.5 m | Sets the safety buffer radius around walls |
| Memory Gain | $k_{mem}$ | 0.0 | 3.0 | Strength of spatial memory to avoid traps |
| Goal Tolerance | $d_{goal}$ | 0.2 m | 0.2 m | Defines the arrival radius for a successful stop |

**Future work** will focus on integrating **SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)** for dynamic map generation and extending the navigation capabilities to include multi-robot coordination. Furthermore, we aim to deploy the developed algorithm onto physical TurtleBot 4 hardware to validate its real-world navigation performance and robustness.
